# Collaborative Drawing and Exploration Backend

This is the API for https://github.com/JosephRodolfo/Drawball-JS-React. It's a collaborative drawing and exploration game where players can move around a nearly infinite board and created drawings out of pixels. This API connects to a MongoDB database and features login and authentication and routes for players, ships, and 100x100 pixel chunks.
